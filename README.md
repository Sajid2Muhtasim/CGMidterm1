Part 1
    Game: ExciteBike
    I used basic sprites to set up the scene. I used 3 square sprites for the tracks and a big square sprite for the background (offroad). I also used a square sprite to represent my player.


Part 2
    Toon Shader
        The toon shader, also known as cel shading, gives a cartoony feel to any 3D object. It uses less shading flat colors to get this effect. 
    How it works?
        Toon shader works by taking different diffuse values based on the light direction to output flat colors. 
        The diffuse lighting will be the brightest where the normal of the surface and the lighting direction is coming from, according to lecture notes. 

Part 3
    Color correction
        This is a process where the colors of each individual pixels are changed in order to change the feel of a scenery. According to the lecture notes, it is used
        to set the mood for a game or film. An example of this is using a sepia filter over a game to change the vibes of it. 
    How it works?

Part 4
    Chosen shader: Bump mapping
    I would use this shader on the track to make the track feel like it has more textures like a normal road/track would have. With the slider, the amount of bump can be
    calibrated to fit the needs of this game. This shader does not change the geometry of the object, but how the lighting and shading works.
